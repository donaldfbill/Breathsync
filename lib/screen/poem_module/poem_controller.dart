    "If humanity were to breathe as one, in Tantric synchrony, a rhythm spun, A collective energy would ignite, Transforming darkness into radiant light.",
    "Inhaling and exhaling in perfect accord, A cosmic dance of unity restored. A symphony of breath, a harmonious flow, Transcending boundaries, letting ego go.",
    // "In this mystical union, a profound shift, A sense of oneness would permeate, As love and compassion reverberate.",
    // "Hearts aligned, connected as a whole, Elevating consciousness, enriching the soul, In this sacred breath, a powerful force, A transformational journey, a divine source.",
    // "Fear and hatred, they would dissipate, in the embrace of unity, they can’t dictate, for when breath intertwines, prejudice fades, Leaving room for acceptance in cascading shades. A tapestry woven of compassion’s thread, Humanity’s potential, fully widespread, Through tantric synchrony, a glimpse we’d see, of our shared essence, our collective destiny. So let us imagine a world entwined, Where breath unites, barriers unwind, In this cosmic rhythm, humanity’s sway, a symphony of togetherness, each and every day.",
